      <description>While we are virtual, we are still committed to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at our event(s). noRth is a conference intended for professional networking and collaboration in the R community. We encourage the open exchange of ideas and expression and thus require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group.
A Code of Conduct is useful to define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of professional practice.</description>
