<p>noRth is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for participants at our event(s). noRth is a conference intended for professional networking and collaboration in the R community. We encourage the open exchange of ideas and expression and thus require an environment that recognizes the inherent worth of every person and group.</p>

<p>A <strong>Code of Conduct</strong> is useful to define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high standards of professional practice. It also provides a benchmark for self evaluation and acts as a vehicle for better identity of the community and organization. If you have general questions about codes of conduct, a good place to start is this <a href="https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq#cocfaq">code of conduct FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>This code (CoC) applies to any participant at noRth, including participants in meetings, teleconferences, and mailing lists, as well as in-person events. Note that this code augments rather than replaces legal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular situation.</p>

<h2 id="expected-behavior">Expected Behavior</h2>

<p>All event participants are expected to behave in accordance with professional standards, with both this Code of Conduct as well as their respective employer&rsquo;s policies governing appropriate workplace behavior, and all applicable laws.</p>

<h2 id="unacceptable-behavior">Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

<p>Harassment will not be tolerated in any form, including but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or any other status protected by laws in which the conference or program is being held.</li>
<li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person&rsquo;s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.</li>
<li>Deliberate misgendering or use of &lsquo;dead&rsquo; or rejected names.</li>
<li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they&rsquo;re not
appropriate.</li>
<li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like
&ldquo;<em>hug</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>backrub</em>&rdquo;) without consent or after a request to stop.</li>
<li>Threats of violence.</li>
<li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.</li>
<li>Deliberate intimidation.</li>
<li>Stalking or following.</li>
<li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for
harassment purposes.</li>
<li>Inappropriate staring.</li>
<li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
<li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.</li>
<li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.</li>
<li>Deliberate &ldquo;outing&rdquo; of any aspect of a person&rsquo;s identity without their consent
except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.</li>
<li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>noRth prioritizes marginalized people&rsquo;s safety over privileged people&rsquo;s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:</p>

<ul>
<li>&lsquo;Reverse&rsquo; -isms, including &lsquo;reverse racism,&rsquo; &lsquo;reverse sexism,&rsquo; and &lsquo;cisphobia&rsquo;.</li>
<li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as &ldquo;leave me alone,&rdquo; &ldquo;go away,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not discussing this with you.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Communicating in a &lsquo;tone&rsquo; you don&rsquo;t find congenial.</li>
<li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-to-do-if-you-witness-or-are-subject-to-unacceptable-behavior">What To Do If You Witness or Are Subject To Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns relating to harassment, please contact a member of event staff immediately. Event staff can be identified by t-shirts/staff badges onsite; and an organizer can be found at the event registration counter at any time. You can contact us at <a href='mailto:rnorthconf@gmail.com'> rnorthconf@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>While this code of conduct applies to spaces associated with noRth, if you are being harassed by a guest/participant of/at noRth outside of our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by noRth participants seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The noRth organizing committee reserves the right to exclude people from noRth based on their past behavior, including behavior outside noRth spaces and behavior towards people who are not part of noRth.</p>

<p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.</p>

<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we&rsquo;ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of noRth participants or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

<p>Conference staff will also provide support to victims, including, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Providing an escort</li>
<li>Contacting hotel/venue security or local law enforcement</li>
<li>Briefing key event staff for response/victim assistance</li>
<li>And otherwise assisting those experiencing harassment to ensure that they feel safe for the duration of the conference.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>

<p>If a participant engages in behavior in violation of the CoC, the conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, ranging from issuing a warning to expulsion from the conference with no refund, depending on the circumstances. noRth reserves the right to exclude any participant found to be engaging in harassing behavior from participating in any further noRth events, trainings or other activities.</p>

<h2 id="pre-event-concerns">Pre-Event Concerns</h2>

<p>If you are planning to attend noRth, and have concerns regarding another individual who may be present, please contact us as soon as possible at <a href='mailto:rnorthconf@gmail.com'> rnorthconf@gmail.com</a>. Precautions will be taken to ensure a victim&rsquo;s comfort and safety, including, but not limited to: providing an escort, prepping onsite event staff, keeping victim and harasser from attending the same talks/social events, and providing onsite contact cell phone numbers for immediate contact.  In extreme cases, we may take action to prevent the harasser from attending the conference.</p>
